# Azure Penetration Testing Lab

## About
This is a pentesting lab Azure build using Terraform! </br>
The final product is a single Resource Group (RG) with public and private subnets. </br>

## Prerequisites
- Create an Azure account
- Install the Microsoft Remote Desktop application if you're using a Mac. Windows machines already have it installed

## Instructions
- Clone this repo to your computer: `git clone https://github.com/uc-cyberclub/azure-pentesting-lab-tf.git`
- `azure-pentesting-lab-tf`
- Login to your Azure account: `az login`, then log in using the browser window that pops up
- `terraform init`
- `terraform apply`
- Read the outputs to try out the resources it builds!

## Deliverables
Once this infrastructure is deployed, two values are provided so you can test it out:</br>
1. IP Address to access a RedHat instance, which is deployed in the public subnet. Your SSH key is in Secrets Manager.
2. DNS address to access an Apache web server, which is deployed in the private subnet.
**NOTE**: the Apache Web Server will show a `502 Bad Gateway` message for about 15 minutes or so.</br>
Try waiting about 10 minutes, and refresh the page.

## Network Diagram
There is an accompanying Network Diagram in the main folder. Be sure to check it out. </br>
It definitely helps to visualize the different resources, and have a sense of their placement within the VPC.

## Resources:
- VPC (in US-East-1)
- Subnets (Two private, two public)
- Route Tables (One for private subnet, one public)
- NAT Gateway
- Internet Gateway
- Standalone EC2 Instance (Public)
- Auto Scaling Group (Spanning both Private Subnets)
- Application Load Balancer (Attached to Auto Scaling Group)
- Security Groups
- S3 Bucket
- KMS
- Secrets Manager
